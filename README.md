# Idle Game

Using this project as my personal project to learn HTML/CSS/Javascript. I'm using https://www.freecodecamp.com to learn the basics and then I want to apply those basics to this Idle Game.

I don't know where it will lead but this is to hopefully avoid another round of tutorial hell. 

The first commit is code generated by ChatGPT. I used the prompt "how can I make a idle game using javascript and webstorm?"
